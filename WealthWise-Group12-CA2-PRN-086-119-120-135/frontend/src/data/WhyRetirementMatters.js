const retirementContent = `Retirement planning is essential for ensuring financial security and peace of mind in your later years. It involves setting goals, saving strategically, and making informed decisions to maintain your desired lifestyle after you stop working. Here's why it matters:

1. Financial Independence
Retirement planning helps you build a nest egg to support yourself without relying on a regular paycheck. By saving and investing early, you can create a sustainable income stream to cover living expenses, healthcare, and leisure activities.

2. Rising Life Expectancy
People are living longer, which means retirement could span 20-30 years or more. Proper planning ensures your savings last throughout your retirement, preventing the risk of outliving your funds.

3. Inflation and Cost of Living
The cost of goods and services increases over time due to inflation. Retirement planning accounts for this by incorporating investments that grow faster than inflation, preserving your purchasing power.

4. Healthcare Costs
As you age, healthcare expenses often rise. A solid retirement plan includes provisions for medical costs, insurance, and potential long-term care, protecting you from unexpected financial burdens.

5. Peace of Mind
Knowing you have a plan in place reduces stress and allows you to enjoy your working years and retirement with confidence. It provides clarity and control over your financial future.

6. Flexibility for Life Goals
Retirement planning isn't just about saving moneyâ€”it's about creating the freedom to pursue your passions, travel, or spend time with loved ones. A well-structured plan aligns your finances with your personal goals.

Start planning today to secure a comfortable and fulfilling retirement tomorrow.`;
